<h2 id="content">Spindle</h2>
<p>The Spindle was the first pen model I developed, and is my interpretation of a flat top. It has gently a gently tapered cap and body, with a small stepdown between body and section. The section is my preferred "bottle neck" design. Instead of being truly flat, the cap and body feature concave ends, perfect for fidgeting with.</p>

<p>Available with 13mm triple start, or 14mm single start cap threads.</p>

<h2 id="content">Augur</h2>
<p>The Augur is my take on the iconic cigar design. Opting for rounded ends with straight lines and parts about as thin as I can safely make them, the Augur has a stepless body/section, and a satisfying slip-to-post cap.</p>

<p>Available with 13mm triple start cap threads.</p>
