			<h1>Commissions</h1>
		</header>	

<h2 id="content">Materials and components</h2>
<p>My preference is to work with high-quality blanks produced by the many phenomenal artists in the community. This usually means a preference for materials like Alumilite or Diamondcast, but other resins, plastics, and ebonite are available as well! I am happy to source most materials, or to discuss customer-sourced materials.</p>

<p>Sleeved materials like wood or fordite are on my to-do list, but not available yet.</p>

<p>Clips are hand carved from brass and stainless steel.</p>

<p>Jowo #6 and Bock 250 nibs are available, as are high polish and satin finishes.</p>

<p>Depending on the model, converter, cartridge, or eyedropper fill can be accomodated. I do not currently have the capacity to produce integrated fill systems.</p>

<h2 id="content">Can you...?</h2>
<p>I am always happy to discuss modifications of my standard models, and special projects. I tend to work cautiously and I reserve the right to refuse a commission if I am not confident that I can complete the work to everyone's expectations, source the desired materials, etc. I don't like over promising.</p>

<h2 id="content">Payment</h2>
<p>I accept payment through PayPal (all customers) or e-transfer (Canadian banking only).</p>
