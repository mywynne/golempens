<h2 id="content">Materials and components</h2>
<p>My preference is to work with high-quality blanks produced by the many phenomenal artists in the community. This usually means a preference for materials like Alumilite or Diamondcast, but other resins, plastics, and ebonite are available as well! I am happy to source most materials, or to discuss customer-sourced materials.</p>

<p>Sleeved materials like wood or ebonite are on my to-do list, but not available yet.</p>

<p>Clips are hand carved from brass and stainless steel.</p>

<p>Depending on the model, converter, cartridge, or eyedropper fill can be accomodated. I do not currently have the capacity to produce integrated fill systems.</p>
