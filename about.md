		<p>Golem pens are made slowly in a small garage in Victoria, BC. Making things, especially things of use, has been a lifelong passion of mine, and working by hand is a refreshing constrast to daily computer life. As the golem behind the tools, if you will, I try to breathe life into everything I make, and ensure that every pen leaving the shop is just right (not necessarily perfect).</p>
